Hi! My name is Ziyad and welcome to my personal Web page. 
I am a PhD student in Le Laboratoire de Mathématiques Jean Leray in Nantes. My work focuses on Topological Data Analysis (or TDA in short), which is a field of applied mathematics that uses algebraic topology to extract information from high-dimensional datasets in a robust manner.
